# Getting Started with TODO APP

## How to start the project:
`git clone https://github.com/aljosa-m/to-do-app.git`
`cd to-do-app`
`npm install`
`npm start`

## User can do the following:
- Create a new todo (will make API call to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos)
- Edit title of existing todos
- Update state (complete) todos
- Filter todos by state
- Delete todo

If there are 0 todos, the app will make an API call to render 10 todo items from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos.
